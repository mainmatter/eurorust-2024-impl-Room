# EuroRust 2024 - `impl Room`

The `impl Room` is a space at [EuroRust 2024](https://eurorust.eu/) for Rustaceans who want to contribute to the 
Rust project or to other crates in the Rust ecosystem.  

If you're a maintainer, you can use this room to mentor new contributors and help them get started with your project.
If you're a contributor, you can use this room to get help with your first contribution or to find a project to contribute to.

## When

There will be two `impl Room` sessions:

- On October 10th 2024, from 16:00 to 17:30 CEST, during the first conference day of EuroRust 2024
- On October 11th 2024, from 16:00 to 17:30 CEST, during the second conference day of EuroRust 2024

When in doubt, refer to the [conference schedule](https://eurorust.eu/schedule/) for the most up-to-date information.

## Where

The `impl Room` will be held in the "Side track" room at the conference venue.  
You'll need a conference ticket to access the room.

## Mentors: how to join 

If you have an idea for a project, [open an issue](https://github.com/mainmatter/eurorust-2024-impl-Room/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project%2C+open&template=project-proposal.md&title=%5BProject+proposal%5D+%3CName+of+the+project%3E) 
with a short project description to find other folks who'd be interested to work on it with you.  

There is no definition of "the right project": the `impl Room` is an occasion to tinker and explore.

Do you need help to work on a PR that closes an issue on the compiler? That's a great project!  
Do you have a fuzzy picture in your mind for a crate that is missing in the ecosystem? Go ahead!

## Contributors: how to join 

Show up at the `impl Room` with your laptop and your curiosity!  
Have a look at the projects that have been proposed by the mentors and join the one that you find interesting.
You can even comment on the project issue beforehand to let the mentor know that you're interested.

Keep in mind that seats are limited, so make sure to show up on time!
